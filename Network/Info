To access methods of a node from a different node with a different data type (class),
you typically need to establish a relationship between the two node classes. This
relationship could be direct or indirect, depending on the structure of your program. Here's a general approach:

Define a Common Interface: If both node classes share common methods or behaviors,
define an interface or a set of methods that both classes implement.

Use Composition or Inheritance: Implement the relationship between the node
classes using composition (where one class contains an instance of another) or inheritance
(where one class extends or inherits from another).

Access Methods Through Relationships: With the relationship established,
 you can access methods of one node class from another by navigating through the relationship.

Here's a simple example to illustrate these concepts:

python
Copy code
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
    
    def display_data(self):
        print("ListNode Data:", self.data)

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
    
    def display_data(self):
        print("TreeNode Data:", self.data)

    def get_list_node_data(self):
        # Assuming there's a ListNode associated with this TreeNode
        if hasattr(self, 'list_node') and isinstance(self.list_node, ListNode):
            return self.list_node.data
        else:
            return None

# Example of establishing a relationship between TreeNode and ListNode
tree_node = TreeNode(10)
list_node = ListNode(5)
tree_node.list_node = list_node  # Associate a ListNode with the TreeNode

# Accessing methods of ListNode from TreeNode
tree_node.list_node.display_data()  # Output: ListNode Data: 5
print("Data of ListNode associated with TreeNode:", tree_node.get_list_node_data())  # Output: Data of ListNode associated with TreeNode: 5
In this example:

Both ListNode and TreeNode classes have a display_data() method.
TreeNode class has an additional method get_list_node_data() to retrieve data from the associated ListNode.
We establish a relationship by associating a ListNode instance with a TreeNode instance (tree_node.list_node = list_node).
We can then access methods of ListNode from TreeNode through this relationship.
This example illustrates a basic way to access methods of a node from a different node with a different data type using Python's object-oriented features. Depending on your specific requirements, you may need to adjust this approach accordingly.
